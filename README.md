# grunt-boilerplate
Simple grunt setup to get you started

## To install the stuff

* Go into directory, run: `npm install`
* This will install all the needed elements from package.json

I'm playing around with grunt for a js project, and I always forget how to set it to be a local server. I'll probably add css + js via uglify soon.
